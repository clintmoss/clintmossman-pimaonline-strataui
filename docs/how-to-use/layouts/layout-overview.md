# Layout Overview

All structural components in Strata UI follow a simple grid pattern.

## Header

At the top of each page is a header. This allows the course designer to add a relatable image and a title for the page. The header helps the student understands what content will be taught on that page.

## Layouts

The rest of the page is organized by columns. All content after the header will fall into either a one column layout, or a two column layout.

[View Two Column Layout Example](/layouts/two-column.md)

### Responsive Design

When you use a one column layout the content blocks and different widgets will resize according to the device width.

If you are using a two-column layout, the columns will collapse at a specific device width and the content will be adjusted accordingly.

## Content Blocks

Within each column are a series of content blocks. The content blocks help add another layer of separation between ideas, content, or learning activities.

## Content & Widgets

Within each content block is where you add text, images, or widgets to create the course content.
