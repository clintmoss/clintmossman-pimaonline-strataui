## Button Links

Links can be styled as buttons by adding a class to the `<a>` tag. `<button>` should not be used for links because that doesn't follow accessibility standards.

### HTML 

Add `class="button"` to links you want to style as buttons. 

```html
<a href="#" class="button">Link</a>
```

<div class="example-container">
  <a href="#" class="button">Link</a>
</div>
