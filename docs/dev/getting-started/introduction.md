# Introduction

Strata UI an Online Course Content Templating System

## What is Strata UI

Strata UI is an HTML-based templating system to create web pages for online courses. By using Strata UI's custom tags, themes, and widgets, anyone can create beautiful, responsive, and interactive online courses.

## For Educators & Instructional Designers

Strata UI was built by Pima Online at Pima Community College and helps provide all educators with tools to easily create web-based online course material with a simple and straight-forward implementation.

Following a true and tried method of code organization and templatization, we wanted to create a tool that was free and accessible to instructional designers and educators everywhere.

## How It Works

After a quick installation of Strata UI, you can add a series of custom HTML tags and traditional HTML tags and are linked to specific CSS and JS.

After deciding on how you want your content organized, just add the course content right into the HTML page. You'll also be able to make theme configuration changes to create a stylized online course.

### Quick Setup

View the [quick start template](getting-started/quick-start) to copy and paste a working template that shows what Strata can do.

### Manual Setup

1. [Install Strata UI](getting-started/installation) by adding the necessary links at the top of your HTML file.
2. [Choose a layout](/layouts/layout-overview.md) depending on the content on the page for your course.
3. [Choose a theme](/themes/preinstalled-themes.md) from pre-installed themes, or just use the default theme.
4. [Add custom HTML tags](getting-started/custom-html-elements) for each widget and content.
