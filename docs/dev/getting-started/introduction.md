# Introduction

Strata UI is an online course content templating system.

## What is Strata UI

Strata UI utilizes a class-based system to create web pages for online courses. By using Strata UI's custom classes, themes, and widgets, anyone can create beautiful, responsive, and interactive online courses.

## For Educators & Instructional Designers

Strata UI was built by The Center for Learning Technology at Pima Community College and helps provide all educators with tools to easily create web-based online course material with a simple and straight-forward implementation.

Following a true and tried method of code organization and templatization, we wanted to create a tool that was free and accessible to instructional designers and educators everywhere.

## How It Works

After a quick installation of Strata UI, you're ready to add your HTML. 

Once you've decided how to organize your content, simply add it directly to the HTML page and add the Strata UI custom classes. You can also configure the theme to create a stylish online course.

### Quick Setup

View the [quick start template](getting-started/quick-start) to copy and paste a working template that shows what Strata UI can do.

### Manual Setup

2. [Choose a layout](/layouts/layout-overview.md) depending on the content on the page for your course.
3. [Choose a theme](/themes/pre-installed-themes.md) from pre-installed themes, or use the default theme.
4. [Add Strata UI classes](getting-started/custom-strata-ui-classes) for each widget and content.
