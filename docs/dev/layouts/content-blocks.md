# Content Blocks

This additional layer of separation improves readability and makes it easier for learners to navigate through the course material.

Within each column are a series of content blocks, which act as containers around your content. These blocks help to visually separate ideas, content, or learning activities, creating a clearer and more organized structure within each column. 

**Note: There should be no text or widgets used outside of content blocks, unless it is within the header.**

## HTML Example

```html
<div class="content-block">
  <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
  <p>
    Curabitur aliquet quam id dui posuere blandit. Curabitur non nulla sit amet nisl tempus convallis quis ac lectus. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla quis lorem ut libero malesuada feugiat.
    Vivamus suscipit tortor eget felis porttitor volutpat. Vivamus magna justo, lacinia eget consectetur sed, convallis at tellus. Proin eget tortor risus. Donec rutrum congue leo eget malesuada.
  </p>
</div>
```
