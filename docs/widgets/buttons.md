# Buttons

Style links as buttons to create eye-catching clickable items.

## How to Use

1. Add `class="button"` to any link to have it styled as a button.

_Note: buttons and the HTML element `<button>` should **not** be used for links because they don't follow accessibility standards. Links should be used when you want to navigate users to a different page or resource, whereas buttons are ideal for triggering actions within the current page, such as submitting a form or opening a modal._

### HTML Example

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="button">Link</a>
```

### Preview

<div class="example-container">
  <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="button">Link</a>
</div>

<div class="footer">
  <p>&copy; 2024 Strata UI</p>
</div>
