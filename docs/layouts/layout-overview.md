# Layout Overview

All structural components in Strata UI follow a simple grid pattern.

## Header

At the top of each page, there is a header where the course designer can add a relevant image and title. This header provides students with a clear indication of the content that will be covered on the page.

## Layouts

Below the header, the page content is organized into columns. After the header, the content will be arranged in either a one-column layout or a two-column layout.

### Responsive Design

With a one-column layout, your content blocks and widgets dynamically adapt to the screen size, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

With a two-column layout, the columns will collapse at a specific device width and the content will be adjusted accordingly.

## Content Blocks

Within each column are a series of content blocks. The content blocks help add another layer of separation between ideas, content, or learning activities.

## Content & Widgets

Within each content block is where you add text, images, or widgets to create the course content.
