    <h2>Quote of the Week</h2>
    <blockquote>
      A menu is a storyteller, a strategy, and a canvas of culinary creativity. It must speak to the heart and appetite of our guests, while reflecting the soul of the kitchen. Every dish listed is a careful balance of cost, popularity, and an expression of our philosophy. It's not just about feeding people; it's about creating an experience that resonates with their spirits and our values. - Chef Alice Waters
