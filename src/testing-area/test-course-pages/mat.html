    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In our exploration of mathematical concepts in this module, we are going to look at the notion of limits. The essence of a limit lies in the idea of approaching a specific point infinitely closely, yet never quite reaching that precise point. This concept is pivotal as it lays the groundwork for comprehending how to calculate the instantaneous rate of change in subsequent studies. By grasping the idea of being infinitely close, we set the stage for more advanced mathematical applications.</p>
    <p>The application of limits extends beyond mere theoretical understanding; it becomes a crucial tool in determining the continuity of a function at a given point. In the realm of mathematics, the continuity of a function is a fundamental aspect, and our understanding of limits serves as a key factor in making such determinations. We will study how applying limits helps assess whether a function maintains its unbroken nature at a specific point.</p>
    <p>As we look deeper into our mathematical foundation, the study of limits and continuity serves as a cornerstone. These concepts provide us with the necessary framework to navigate the complexities of mathematical analysis.</p>
    <h3>Real Deal</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Engineering and Design: Imagine designing a bridge. Engineers need to ensure that the road surface is smooth and continuous to provide safe passage for vehicles. They use mathematical concepts of limits and continuity to design smooth curves and transitions, ensuring that the road surface doesn't abruptly change elevation or direction, which could lead to accidents.</li>
      <li>Computer Graphics: In computer graphics and animation, smooth and continuous movement of objects is essential for creating realistic simulations. Concepts of limits and continuity are used to ensure that animations appear seamless and fluid, without any noticeable jumps or breaks in motion.</li>
      <li>Financial Analysis: In finance, the concept of continuity is vital for analyzing financial data and trends. For instance, when plotting a graph of stock prices over time, investors want to ensure that the graph is continuous and doesn't have sudden jumps or gaps. Mathematical tools based on limits help in smoothing out data and identifying trends accurately.</li>
      <li>Environmental Monitoring: In environmental science, researchers use continuous monitoring systems to track changes in environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and pollution levels. Concepts of limits and continuity are employed to ensure that the data collected is accurate and reflects the true state of the environment without any sudden disruptions or inconsistencies.</li>
      <li>Healthcare: In healthcare, continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, is crucial for early detection of health problems. Medical devices and sensors use mathematical algorithms based on limits and continuity to ensure that the data collected is reliable and free from errors or interruptions.</li>
